# Javascript Clock Project
In this project I followed Web Dev Simplified's YouTube video, Build A Clock With Javascript, to implement Javascript into HTML and CSS.

I had felt as though I had learnt a lot with Codecademy, but I was just struggling to figure out how to put it all together in a practical way.

So, in this project I focussed less on the syntax and what I was building (the actual clock project) and more on putting things together such as Git and GitHub version control and linking Javascript to HTML and CSS.

I am still trying to comprehend how Javascript, React and Redux are really implemented into a project. I understand HTML and CSS, and I understand Javascript, React and Redux syntax, but I am struggling to put it all together to build a project of my own. So this will be a focus of mine for now.
